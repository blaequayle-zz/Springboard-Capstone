### Capstone Project: Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Street Crime in Inner London

This repository contains the documentation and code for my Capstone project undertaken as part of Springboard's Foundation of Data Science course between April and July 2017 with support from my mentor Dhiraj Khanna.

The sections of the Capstone project include:
1. [Project Proposal](Capstone_project_proposal.md) - this covers the problem to solve, the client and why they care about the problem, the dataset, the approach to solving the problem and the deliverables. The final idea was selected from three initial proposals which can be found [here](Capstone_project_ideas.md).
2. [Data collection](Data_Acquisition.R) - via download, APIs or web scraping as appropriate.
3. [Data wrangling](Data_Wrangling.R) - perform data cleaning, deal with missing values and outliers. There is a written summary of this step [here](Data_wrangling.md).
4. [Exploratory data analysis](Exploratory_Data_Analysis.md) - use a combination of inferential statistics and data visualization to identify interesting trends and features. The accompanying code is split into three files [Part 1](Analysis_1.R), [Part 2](Analysis_2.R) and [Part 3](Analysis_3.R). Part 2 focusses on using KDE and Part 3 uses chloropleth maps.
5. [Milestone report](Milestone_Report.md) - practice your data storytelling skills in this report summarising the work carried out, plan multiple milestones with your mentor.
6. Final deliverables - [final report](Final_Report/Capstone_Final.pdf) explaining problem, approach and findings, well documented code, slide pack. The final report is in pdf format to avoid the issues experienced when using leaflet to display kde maps.
