### Capstone Project: Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Street Crime in Inner London

This repository contains the documentation and code for my Capstone project undertaken as part of Springboard's Foundation of Data Science course.

The sections of the Capstone project include:
1. Project proposal - this covers the problem to solve, the client and why they care about the problem, the dataset, the approach to solving the problem and the deliverables.
2. Data collection - via download, APIs or web scraping as appropriate.
3. Data wrangling - perform data cleaning, deal with missing values and outliers.
4. Exploratory data analysis - use a combination of inferential statistics and data visualization to identify interesting trends and features.
5. Milestone report - practice your data storytelling skills in this report summarising the work carried out, plan multiple milestones with your mentor.
6. Final deliverables - final report explaining problem, approach and findings, well documented code, slide pack.
